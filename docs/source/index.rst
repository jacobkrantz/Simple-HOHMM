Simple-HOHMM documentation
==========================

Simple-HOHMM is an end-to-end sequence classifier using Hidden Markov Models. Let the builder construct a model for you based on chosen model attributes. Now you can solve the classic problems of HMMs: evaluating, decoding, and learning. Play with different orders of history to maximize the accuracy of your model.

This documentation is under development, but the tutorials are a good place to start.
